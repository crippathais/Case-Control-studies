# Case-Control-studies

Case-Controls studies in WES, WGS and Snparrays can be almost the same after you have a VCF input.

Here I present the "normal" flow for thsi type of study with the possible softwares and why to make each step. To deepen and test I also have a script wrote in Bash and also in R Markdown for teh one's hwho prefer graphical interface.

```bash
CaseControl_RareVar.sh
CaseControl_RareVar.RMarkdown

```

```bash
CaseControl_CommonVar.sh
CaseControl_Commonr.RMarkdown

```
