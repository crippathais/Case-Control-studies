# Case-Control-studies

Basic flow with the possible softwares for rare variants and for common variants . To deepen and test I also have a script wrote in Bash and also in R Markdown.

```bash
CaseControl_RareVar.sh
```

```bash
CaseControl_CommonVar.sh
```

Auxiliaries scripts:
imiss-vs-het.Rscript
lmiss-hist.Rscript
